      Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta
      Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004,
      lasting ten seasons.[1] With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston,
      Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David
      Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and early 30s
      who live in Manhattan, New York City. The original executive producers
      were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane. Kauffman and Crane began
      developing Friends under the working title Insomnia Cafe between November
      and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they
      pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script
      rewrites and changes, including title changes to Six of One[2] and Friends
      Like Us, the series was finally named Friends.[3] Filming took place at
      Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The series was produced by
      Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
